# Microservices Flowerffinity

This repo is dedicated to store most of the files that I create while learning from the ebook, *Bootstrapping Microservices (2nd edition) With Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and Terraform* by **Ashley Davis**. I'm accessing this book through the Toronto Public Library via O'Reilly Learning.

Apparently I'm going to end up making a video-streaming service using microservices...? Sounds cool, and I will hopefully develop some experience with Docker and Kubernetes in the process.

## Getting Started 

The files in this repo are likely going to end up like the files presented in the book, with some variable name changes here and there just to keep things interesting and personalized for myself.

This book has also provided a link to all of the completed code examples shown in the book, in case you would rather follow that: https://github.com/bootstrapping-microservices-2nd-edition

### Prerequisites

Please install Node.js and get a copy of the book if you want to follow along.
